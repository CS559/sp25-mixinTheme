# Mixin "Theme" for CS559 2023 Hugo Sites

This "theme" has things used for both the main web page as well as the workbooks.

It consists of data and shortcode, but no page layouts - so it isn't really a theme,
it's really a "theme mixin" (although, arguably, 559Theme isn't a complete theme either).
Hugo has no terminology for a "partial theme".

**Note:** the `workbooks.toml` file (with the rubrics) has been moved to the main workbook
repository.
