# Mixin "Theme" for CS559 2025 Hugo Sites

This "theme" has things used for both the main web page as well as the workbooks.

It consists of data and shortcode, but no page layouts - so it isn't really a theme,
it's really a "theme mixin" (although, arguably, 559Theme isn't a complete theme either).
Hugo has no terminology for a "partial theme".

**Note:** the `workbooks.toml` file (with the rubrics) has been moved to the main workbook
repository (in the "wb" theme that is not a submodule).

# Some notes about content...

The files here:

- pages.yaml is a list of commonly referred to web pages accessed in either the course web or the workbooks. Be careful about section/semester specific links. It is accessed by the "page" shortcode. 
- assigns.yaml and files.yaml are lists of what is in canvas - they must be generated by python scripts

We will not use assigns.yaml and files.yaml in 2025. (or, if we do, it needs to be in the per-section course web).
